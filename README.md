# CrackingCodes

Cracking Codes is an ongoing project, base on the book with the same name by Al Sweigart.

First Code almost entire designed by me, with some substance.

The files under this project are:

- Cifra_1.py
- cifraTransposicaoEncriptaDesencripta.py
- "anyfile.txt"

"Cifra_1.py" is a cypher/decypher program by transposition. It calls a module named "cifraTransposicaoEncriptaDesencripta.py", and here is where the magic hapens.

The user chooses from 3 options: Cifra(Cypher), Decifra(Decypher) or Quit.

"Cifra" reads a message, cypher it, and then saves it to a ".txt" file.

"Decifra" reads a message from a ".txt" file, and decypher. 

To cypher or decypher, you will need a key.
